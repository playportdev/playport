# 2026-10-29: Social Club on Rockstar's own CEF, with and without single-process (PLA-476 chunk 1)

**Linear:** [PLA-476](https://linear.app/playportdev/issue/PLA-476),
[PLA-477](https://linear.app/playportdev/issue/PLA-477), [PLA-364](https://linear.app/playportdev/issue/PLA-364).
**Plan:** [2026-10-29-sc-stock-cef.md](../plans/2026-10-29-sc-stock-cef.md), chunk 1.

## Build and runs

- **IPA (dev):** `defe3d01ee144147ffcb11e8d11ea5c640a15493ddb0fa361bb8acae374ec33e` (`87dbf80`). It adds the dev
  runtime key `env.PLAYPORT_CEF_SWAP=0`, which leaves a client's CEF in place, as in the release IPA.
- **Settings:** RDR2's defaults (decision 0153), aspect 16:9 and `donorPoolMB=auto`, plus the arm's runtime keys.
  Decisions 0133 and 0138 were on, as by default.
- **a1** (`.work/ui-runs/20261029T135747-rdr2-p476a1`, host log `$PLAYPORT_BUILD/agent-notes/pla476/a1-live/`):
  `env.PLAYPORT_CEF_SWAP=0`.
- **a2** (`.work/ui-runs/20261029T142514-rdr2-p476a2`, host log `$PLAYPORT_BUILD/agent-notes/pla476/a2-live/`):
  `env.PLAYPORT_CEF_SWAP=0 env.PLAYPORT_SC_SINGLE=1`.
- **How the runs ended.** Both were ended by hand once the launcher showed its Error window (a1 ran ~6 min, a2
  ~5 min). In a1 the owner pressed the window's Confirm: the run's harness waited for the game's first frame and
  did not recognise the launcher's own window. The later runner (`agent-notes/pla476/arm.sh`) ends a run with no
  Story press by +360 s and never presses on an error.

## Results

| | a1: Rockstar's CEF | a2: Rockstar's CEF, single-process |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[cef-swap]` | `PLAYPORT_CEF_SWAP=0: every client's CEF is left alone` | the same |
| `[sc-single] preflight … accepted` / `verified browser` / `[sc-rph]` | — | one each per helper start |
| `SocialClubHelper.exe` starts | 30 (one every 5 s) | 51 |
| their exits | 29 × `0x80000003`, 1 × `0xE0000008` | 50 × `0x80000003` |
| launcher | its Error window; alive | the same |
| game | never started | never started |

- **The single-process patch applied to Rockstar's helper.** The exact-build guard, `--single-process` and
  page-bridge installation logged at every helper start on stock CEF. This does not prove the bridge works:
  the helper failed during allocator startup, before a page or successful sign-in could exercise it.
- **Each helper still dies at its PartitionAlloc reservations.** In a2's second helper:
  - `jumbo#2`: chrome_elf.dll's glued pools, 32 GB at a 32 GB-aligned hint, "granted" as a soft pool at
    `0x7800000000` (PLA-477);
  - `jumbo#3`: 16 GB, its metadata region, real at `0x756eed0000`, over the soft range;
  - `jumbo#4`–`#6`: libcef.dll's pools, 32 GB at 32 GB-aligned hints, refused (`NO GAP FITS`, `0xc000000d`);
  - `jumbo#7`–`#8`: 64 GB − 64 KB with no hint (PartitionAlloc's reserve-and-trim fallback for an aligned block),
    refused (`0xc0000017`).
  - Then the helper exits with `0x80000003`.
- **The map when the helper asks** (a2's walk): `[0x707c1c0000, 0x73e20e0000)` 13.9 GB free (the furniture
  window) and `[0x73ffff0000, 0x79d0000000)` 23.8 GB free. Above them, RDR2's jumbo hold `[0x79d0000000,
  0x7c00000000)` and FEX's arena `[0x7c00000000, 0x8000000000)`. The JIT pool's RW alias is at `0x7007b14000`
  (`VM_FLAGS_ANYWHERE`), with the app's earlier mappings below it from `0x7000000000`.

## What a stock CEF needs here

Per the desktop recon ([cef-swap test](2026-10-16-cef-swap-test.md#stock-cefclients-reservations)) and
willfaust/Madeira's layout 2 (`virtual_ios.c`, `MADEIRA_SC_PA_POOLS`), a single-process helper asks for:

- three 32 GB blocks on 32 GB boundaries: chrome_elf.dll's pools, libcef.dll's pools, and Oilpan's cage;
- two 16 GB metadata regions;
- V8's sandbox (a 1.3 TB placeholder through `NtAllocateVirtualMemoryEx`, which V8 retries smaller);
- and 1 GB.

The window has two 32 GB boundaries, `0x7000000000` and `0x7800000000`. Upstream fits all of these by
reserving only the bottom of each block for real and laying out the band for it:

- the app holds `[0x7000000000, +4 GB)` before Wine starts, and the furniture floor moves above it;
- the JIT RW alias moves to `0x7900000000`;
- FEX's arena moves up (to `0x7c40000000` in the RDR2 geometry), so that Oilpan's cage sits in chrome_elf.dll's
  BackupRefPtr half;
- the metadata regions and RDR2.exe's 8960 MB hold sit in `[0x7400000000, 0x7800000000)`;
- V8's sandbox is a partial 8 GB reservation.

These touch shared placement code, but the new layout need not be enabled for every game. The port must
keep the existing layout when the Social Club layout is not selected. Whether an earlier app-wide hold is
needed to keep the low slot free remains to be tested; the probes did not establish that requirement.

## Not shown

The game's own helper never started, so nothing here shows whether two helpers (the launcher's and the game's,
alive together until the game's sign-in, decision 0130) can share one such layout.
